I'll analyze the handwritten notes to extract the bug reports and investigate the codebase.

Bug Reports from Images
From the handwritten notes, I can identify the following issues:

Portfolio Page Issue: When tapping on "Total Invested, Active Investors, and Avg Returns" it should be able to display all your investors

Based on my analysis of the handwritten notes and codebase investigation, here's a comprehensive Bug Report and Fix Plan:

📋 BUG REPORTS IDENTIFIED
1. Portfolio Page - Missing "All Investors" Display
Issue: When tapping on "Total Invested, Active Investors, and Avg Returns" it should display all your investors.

Location: packages/web/src/js/pages/portfolio.js

Root Cause: The portfolio page only shows aggregate stats but doesn't have a clickable feature to view detailed investor list or investment breakdown.

Current Behavior: Stats are displayed as static cards without any interaction.

2. Withdraw Profits - Missing Payment Method Selection
Issue: When tapping on withdraw profits, it should be able to take you to either momo or bank account.

Location: packages/web/src/js/pages/wallet.js (lines 197-305)

Root Cause: The withdrawal modal only shows bank account option. There's no Mobile Money (MoMo) option implemented.

Current Behavior: Only bank withdrawal is available in showWithdrawModal() function.

3. Missing Risk Disclosure Confirmation Checkbox
Issue: Don't agree on the form (Risk disclosure) to confirm "I can afford to lose my entire investment account"

Location: packages/web/src/js/pages/projects.js (lines 211-229)

Root Cause: The investment modal has 3 checkboxes but is missing the critical "I can afford to lose my entire investment" acknowledgment.

Current Checkboxes:

Terms & Conditions
Profits NOT guaranteed
Principal locked for X months
Missing: "I can afford to lose my entire investment" checkbox

4. Email Verification Not Implemented
Issue: A link must be sent to your email when you are new and you want to log in and create a new account.

Location: packages/backend/src/routes/auth.js

Root Cause: Email verification system is not implemented. Users can sign up without email verification.

Current Behavior: User account is created immediately without email verification step.

5. Currency Symbol Input Issue
Issue: When you type on the currency symbol it should take/open up sometimes (unclear from notes, likely referring to currency input field behavior)

Location: Multiple input fields across investment and wallet pages

Root Cause: Currency inputs don't have proper formatting or currency symbol handling. The GH₵ symbol is hardcoded in labels but not interactive.

6. Missing Favicon
Issue: There is no favicon

Location: packages/web/src/index.html (line 7) and packages/web/public/favicon.ico

Root Cause:

No favicon link tag in HTML
The favicon.ico file exists but is empty (1 byte)
7. Investment Projects Category Filter Issue (Incomplete in notes)
Issue: "When you tap on all categories and you..." (note was cut off)

Location: packages/web/src/js/pages/projects.js (lines 8-24)

Potential Issue: Category filter might not be working properly or has UX issues.
